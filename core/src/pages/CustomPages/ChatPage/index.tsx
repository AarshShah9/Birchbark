          Hello Dr. Sander. I have been having this terrible pain in my throat.
          I filled out the survey and am coming to see you later today. Is there
          anything I can do in the meantime to deal with the pain. ðŸ™‚

        <Question time="2 mins ago">
          Hi Tina, I am sorry to hear about your throat. I got the survey and
          the images of your throat. It looks like it could be strep throat. For
          now, just drink some warm soothing liquids, I can probably get you in
          a bit early over my lunch break around 12:30 if that works for you?
        </Question>
        <Answer time="Just now">
          That would be great. Thank you so much Dr. Sander. See you soon, Tina.
